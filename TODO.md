- [x] see what gpt&co can be used for (not embeddding, not similar...)
    - it's used for "chat" features, independant from embeddings stuff
- [x] filter archived datasets
- [ ] find another embedding model optimized for FR long descs
    - how to add another model to llm embed locally and remotely?
        - https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/writing-plugins.html
- [ ] see how to deploy a "search" POC with datasette and dokku
    - compute embeddings through current logic
    - ship it to remote server
        - datasette should provide an API to the embeddings database
    - use https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-llm-embed on remote server
        - that creates an API endpoint which can:
            - compute embedding for the search query
            - compute similarity of search query vs computed embeddings
    - need an interface to call the APIs
        - eg https://observablehq.com/@simonw/search-for-faucets-with-clip-api
        - this could "unwrap" the dataset from data.gouv.fr too
            - Flask + HTMX? Vuejs? Datasette plugin?
        - can also compute similarities from a dataset easily
